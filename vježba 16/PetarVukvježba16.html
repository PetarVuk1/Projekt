	<p>National Basketball Association (NBA) je najistaknutija muška profesionalna košarkaška liga u Sjevernoj Americi. Regularna sezona NBA lige počinje u jesen, obično krajem listopada ili početkom studenog, a u njoj svaki klub igra 82 utakmice jednako raspoređene na domaće i gostujuće. Liga se dijeli na istočnu i zapadnu konferenciju, a svaku čini 15 klubova podijeljenih u tri divizije. Jedna momčad u regularnoj sezoni četiri puta igra sa svakim protivnikom iz iste divizije (16 utakmica), tri do četiri puta sa svakim protivnikom iz ostale dvije divizije u istoj konferenciji (36 utakmica) i po dva puta sa svakim protivnikom iz druge konferencije (30 utakmica). Regularna sezona završava krajem travnja, kada započinje doigravanje (eng. playoff) u koje se uvrštava po osam najboljih klubova iz svake konferencije. U prvom krugu doigravanja klubovi su podijeljeni u četiri para, a u svakom paru isti suparnici igraju međusobne utakmice sve dok jedan od njih ne ostvari četiri pobjede kako bi se kvalificirao u konferencijsko polufinale. Dva kluba koji u polufinalu prvi ostvare četiri pobjede ulaze u konferencijsko finale u kojem također igraju do četiri ostvarene pobjede. Pobjednici konferencijskih finala međusobno se susreću u NBA finalu, koje se održava tijekom lipnja, a klub koji u njemu prvi ostvari četiri pobjede postaje prvakom lige.The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.[9] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[10]

On August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams–Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo–merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including Maurice Podoloff as president.[10] To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.[11]

The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[12] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.

Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[13][14] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[13][15] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.[16] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.[17] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.</p>
